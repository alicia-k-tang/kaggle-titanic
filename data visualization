#Before we create a predictive model, cleaning and visualizing the data is paramount to gaining insight on the dataset.

#First, let's load and clean the data.

#Setting working directory
setwd("C:/Users/Alice/Downloads")

#Importing the training and testing datasets from Kaggle.
titanic.train <- read.csv(file="train.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, header= TRUE)
titanic.test <- read.csv(file="test.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, header= TRUE)

#Next, we are displaying descriptive statistics.
str(titanic.train)
summary(titanic.train)

#Now, we are providing data visualization. Let's use ggplot2!
library(ggplot2)

#The plot below shows the overall Survived count.
ggplot(titanic.train, aes(x = Survived)) +
  geom_bar(width=0.5, fill = "purple") +
  geom_text(stat='count', aes(label=stat(count)), vjust=-0.5) +
  theme_classic()
 
#Next, we show survived by Sex.
titanic.train$Sex <- as.factor(titanic.train$Sex)
ggplot(data = titanic.train, mapping = aes(x = Survived, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_bar()
  
#Now by Age, Pclass, and Sex.
ggplot(titanic.train, aes(x = Age, fill = Survived)) +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(Sex ~ Pclass) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) +
  labs(y = "Age",
       x = "Survived",
       title = "Titanic Survival Rates by Age, Pclass and Sex")
  
#Let's view survived by Age. This is handy because we are able to see the clear outliers in the data.
ggplot(titanic.train, aes(x = Survived, y = Age)) +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(y = "Age",
       x = "Survived",
       title = "Titanic Survival Rates by Age")
