# kaggle-titanic
The legendary Titanic ML competition on Kaggle that I completed for my Data Analysis course.

This Kaggle competition wanted participants to take a deeper look into the tragic shipwreck of 1912— the Titanic. Though luck was involved to survive this disaster, it is argued bthat certain factors contributed to a passenger’s survival. Participants were tasked with creating a predictive model that would determine which types of people were more likely to survive by using passenger data. This problem is worth investigating since it is interesting to see how different factors affected the survival rate.
